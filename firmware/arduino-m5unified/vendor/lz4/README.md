`bringup/lz4_codec.cpp` compiles this implementation with `LZ4_MEMORY_USAGE=12`.
The adapter uses `LZ4_compress_fast_extState` with caller-owned, aligned state;
no codec heap allocation is used. Raw blocks map to Parquet enum 7 (`LZ4_RAW`),
not LZ4 Frame or deprecated enum 5. Default acceleration is 1.

Vendored source is excluded from formatting and project lint diagnostics; the
adapter/writer are linted and the actual linked codec runs in ASan/UBSan tests.
Recheck upstream and update this pin/hash record deliberately before upgrades.
