# Parquet compression experiment

[Router](README.md) · Implementation, host screening and device comparison verified **2026-09-08**. Exact device evidence lives in [bench-verified](bench-verified.md). This stays in the existing Arduino trial; no second framework or radio/upload implementation is introduced.

## Design and scope

The writer now accepts **UNCOMPRESSED** or **LZ4_RAW**. LZ4 1.10.0 is vendored with source hashes and BSD-2-Clause notices in the [trial pin](../firmware/arduino-m5unified/vendor/lz4/README.md). The adapter uses raw blocks and Parquet codec enum **7**, not deprecated enum 5 or LZ4 Frame. PyArrow's Python metadata API displays enum 7 as `LZ4`. [Parquet codec contract](https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/Compression.md), [LZ4 API](https://github.com/lz4/lz4/blob/v1.10.0/lib/lz4.h)

Every DataPageV1 payload, including its definition-level stream, is compressed as one block. Page headers retain both compressed and original byte counts; footer column chunks and row-group totals distinguish compressed from uncompressed sizes. Headers/footer are not page-compressed. One codec applies throughout a file, even where a very small page grows. A codec error aborts the partial file rather than writing raw bytes labeled as compressed.

The logger still has 73 columns and at most 90 rows. Uncompressed streaming supports the larger generic writer limits; compressed calls must fit the supplied page scratch or fail before output starts. Firmware reserves 1,024 bytes of raw scratch, enough for its 90-row flat numeric schema, plus `LZ4_COMPRESSBOUND(1024)` output scratch and aligned external LZ4 state with `LZ4_MEMORY_USAGE=12`. There is no per-page codec heap allocation. The format workspace grew from 2,048 to **2,816 bytes** to track original column sizes. These buffers are in the PSRAM writer allocation, not on the task stack; the 16 KiB task stack and 4 KiB stdio staging remain unchanged. Static bounds/free-heap observations are not a whole-system allocation trace or radio-load memory guarantee.

`parquet codec none` and `parquet codec lz4` first finalize pending normal rows under the old codec, then change the running session. Reboot returns to UNCOMPRESSED. Existing files are never recompressed or overwritten. Uncompressed is an explicit user-selectable fallback, not silent fallback on codec failure.

`parquet codec-test` writes two diagnostic copies of the **same buffered rows**, first uncompressed and then LZ4, under `output/benchmarks/boot=<boot>/`. It retains the original batch for normal rotation. Copies carry `purpose=codec-comparison-duplicate-rows` metadata; normal output carries `purpose=telemetry`. Do not include benchmark copies in station telemetry queries. The finalized-file counter includes these diagnostic writes.

## Host screening, not device timing

Input: 54 real rows × 73 columns from `data_1845_1491409bed013e1999dc4072ac91ab0f_26-79-5.parquet`, SHA-256 `4601fe0a41bdb8d00b946c89001d2a1164484565d6d35e3be7a4ea1d7a46beb9`. PyArrow 25.0.0 rewrote identical values using PLAIN, DataPageV1, no dictionaries, no statistics and no serialized Arrow schema. Both PyArrow and DuckDB 1.5.5 matched the original stored values/nulls for every codec. Ten host writes per candidate:

| Codec | Whole-file bytes | Footer bytes | Host median write, µs |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| UNCOMPRESSED | 27,344 | 6,139 | 346.7 |
| Snappy | 14,213 | 6,055 | 389.7 |
| LZ4_RAW | 14,164 | 6,056 | 369.9 |
| Zstd level 1 | 13,264 | 6,057 | 472.8 |

This screens candidates, not firmware speed or peak memory. PyArrow's page headers/footer differ from the custom writer, so the original 26,828-byte device file is not this table's uncompressed denominator. LZ4 was selected for the first board implementation because it was close to Snappy in whole-file size and offers explicit small external state. Zstd's additional host size saving does not establish its device memory/time tradeoff. Snappy and Zstd are **not implemented on the board**.

## Hardware result: LZ4 passed

Same Board 1, same mounted card, **60 real rows × 73 columns**, sequences 0–59, boot `e452563e96c72ca057a48924550779b6`; no radio load. Three paired writes on the device used identical buffered values/nulls. All six readbacks passed both readers and paired-table equality. The rows were unsynchronized (UTC null) during this controlled comparison; normal host time was restored afterward.

| Measurement | UNCOMPRESSED | LZ4_RAW |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Complete-file bytes | 28,537 | **14,080** |
| Finalization range, µs | 113,828–122,849 | **91,777–98,629** |
| Median finalization, µs (3 writes) | 118,420 | **93,036** |
| Writer/sink range, µs | 36,650–36,777 | 33,797–35,057 |
| LZ4 calls only, µs | 0 | **3,323–3,658** |
| Flush/sync/close range, µs | 13,284–15,716 | 12,505–12,658 |

LZ4 reduced total bytes by **50.7%** and median observed finalization by **21.4%**. Fixed codec workspace was **6,208 bytes**, with no per-page codec allocation; runtime reports after writes showed 308,260 bytes free internal heap, 8,281,644 bytes free PSRAM and 5,216 bytes free storage-task stack. The minimum internal heap report reached 307,424 bytes during the test. These are scoped observations and a static workspace bound, not a global peak-allocation trace.

Final comparison status: 60 normal rows still buffered, six diagnostic files finalized, zero drops/errors, queue high-water 1. The original rows remained available for normal telemetry. All three copies for each codec were byte-identical. [Exact hashes, cadence and image](bench-verified.md#board-1-lz4-compression).

Evidence is retained in `firmware/arduino-m5unified/artifacts/compression-20260908/`: `report.json`, `device.log` and all six files. Current normal logging can use LZ4, while reboot retains the conservative UNCOMPRESSED default. Compression does not change the RAM-loss or SD power-loss limitations.

The follow-up normal 64-row file retained the original 60 rows unchanged, plus contiguous post-comparison sequences 60–63, with no recorded drops/deadline misses/storage errors. A subsequent three-row **normal LZ4 Hive file** passed both readers and UTC partition checks after host time was restored. Both codec configuration commands acknowledged successfully; the device was left at 900 seconds with LZ4 selected.

**Meaning of “better”:** smaller complete files and lower median finalization time on these three paired writes, with interoperable values/nulls preserved. It does not mean every write is faster: a later 12-row normal LZ4 file took 140,291 µs to finalize, demonstrating SD/I/O variability beyond the paired range. It also does not establish energy savings, greater card lifetime or proportional allocated-space savings. FAT cluster rounding can erase the space benefit for small files; see [offline capacity](telemetry-pipeline.md#offline-capacity-and-reconnection). Snappy/Zstd, full compressed-window endurance and reconnect/upload tests remain open.

## Reproduce and retain evidence

Run from the repository root, with only one process owning the serial port:

```sh
pixi run parquet-test --sanitize
pixi run compression-bench <exported-file.parquet> --repeats 10
pixi run python tools/benchmark_device_compression.py --port /dev/cu.usbmodem101 --out firmware/arduino-m5unified/artifacts/compression-new --min-rows 60 --seconds 700 --repeats 3
pixi run parquet-device command --port /dev/cu.usbmodem101 'parquet codec lz4'
pixi run parquet-device command --port /dev/cu.usbmodem101 'parquet codec none'
```

The device helper does not reset, change the clock or alter the normal interval/codec. It waits for a minimum buffered row count, creates repeated comparison pairs, retrieves and independently validates each file, then checks that each compressed table equals its baseline. A time-aligned partial window may rotate before reaching the requested count; use a sufficient bounded timeout or start just after a new window. Its JSON report/log live in the new output directory. The tests deliberately duplicate data only in the benchmark tree.

Interpret `codec_us` as time inside LZ4 calls only; `writer_us` includes serialization and sink calls; `write_us` includes complete finalization/readback/CRC/rename, and `sync_us` is the flush/sync/close subset. Compare complete-file bytes and all relevant timings, not codec CPU alone. Three repetitions are not p99 or endurance qualification. Record sampling jitter/drops across writes and free/minimum heap, PSRAM and stack reports alongside the explicit workspace bound.

**Artifact lesson:** Arduino cleaned the previous `build/` contents during a changed-configuration rebuild. All 13 saved Parquet files were restored from the card and revalidated under `firmware/arduino-m5unified/artifacts/exports/restored-20260908/`, including legacy files. Earlier build-local serial logs were not recovered. Use git-ignored `artifacts/` for exports, logs, reports and retained binaries; `build/` is disposable. Current firmware exposes old `/sd/parquet/` files through the read-only `legacy-parquet/` prefix. `tools/export_parquet.py` retrieves every listed finalized file without flushing or deleting device data.

Power-cut recovery, card faults, compressed full-window endurance, radio/display stress and on-device Snappy/Zstd comparisons remain separate qualification work.
