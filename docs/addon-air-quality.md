# Optional accessory: M134 air-quality module

Read only when this accessory is selected; CoreS3 does not contain these sensors.
Source-checked 2026-09-06 and bench-updated 2026-09-08. Wiring remains a schematic comparison; the PMS UART path is now verified on Board 1.

## Identify the hardware first

- The supplied [shop URL](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/pm2-5-air-quality-kit) now names **M134 / PMSA003 module**, excluding the controller. The historical kit bundled a classic ESP32 Core and SHT20; its firmware is not a CoreS3 board definition.
- Current [M134 documentation](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/products/sku/M134) lists PMSA003; its linked [schematic](https://m5stack-doc.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/1030/Module-Air-Quality.pdf) also contains **U2 SHT20**. Check actual PCB revision/population; absence from the product specification table does not establish absence of SHT20.
- PMSA003 is the UART particulate sensor; temperature/RH comes from the separate SHT20.

## CoreS3 connection and collision audit

Physical **M5-Bus position** is the translation key; old schematic `GPIOxx` labels name the classic Core. Map positions through the [CoreS3 pinout](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/CoreS3#pinmap).

| Accessory signal | Physical bus position | CoreS3 connection |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PMS TX → host RX | 15 | GPIO18; also Port C RX |
| PMS RX ← host TX | 16 | GPIO17; also Port C TX |
| SHT20 SDA / SCL | 17 / 18 | GPIO12 / GPIO11; **internal** I²C |
| PMS SET | 22 | GPIO7; reserve if fitted |
| PMS RESET | 6 | RST/EN, shared host reset |
| Supply | 28 / 12 / 1,3,5 | 5 V / 3.3 V / GND |

The [schematic](https://m5stack-doc.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/1030/Module-Air-Quality.pdf) routes SET/RESET where the web PinMap says NC. Verify actual revision continuity; reset is shared with the host.

**SHT20 and CoreS3 ES7210 both use address `0x40` on bus positions 17/18.** This collision follows from the schematic, [SHT20 datasheet §5.3](https://sensirion.com/resource/datasheet/sht20), and [CoreS3 codec pinout](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/CoreS3#pinmap).
Use a routing adapter that disconnects the accessory SDA/SCL from the internal bus and connects them to external Port A GPIO2/GPIO1, or electrically isolate that accessory branch behind a mux. Adding wires while retaining the original connections joins the buses; software address changes or disabling microphone sampling do not isolate two fixed-address devices. For PM-only operation, isolate the accessory I²C branch before normal codec initialization too.

Reserve GPIO17/18 against other Port C/UART users. Explicit Arduino UART pins: `begin(9600, SERIAL_8N1, 18, 17)` on an allocated `HardwareSerial`; two sensor TX outputs cannot share RX.
The schematic's J3 USB-C connects VBUS directly to bus 5 V and carries no USB data; check the host power path before feeding it. [Schematic](https://m5stack-doc.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/1030/Module-Air-Quality.pdf)

## PMSA003: wire contract

[Plantower datasheet V2.5](https://m5stack.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/resource/docs/datasheet/base/PMSA003_cn.pdf): electrical/interface pp.2–5; installation p.11; protocol appendices pp.12–14.

| Item | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| Power / logic | Sensor 4.5–5.5 V, ≤100 mA working / ≤200 µA standby; UART/control 3.3 V |
| Sensor connector | 1/2 VCC; 3/4 GND; 5 RESET; 7 RX; 9 TX; 10 SET; 6/8 unused |
| SET / RESET | SET low sleeps; high/floating runs. RESET low resets; internal pull-ups |
| Wake | Allow ≥30 s fan stabilization after sleep; budget the same acquisition gate at startup |
| Serial | 9600 8N1; 32-byte measurement frame; big-endian words |
| Frame | `42 4D`, length `001C`; checksum `sum(bytes[0..29]) == BE16(bytes[30..31])` |
| PM fields | Byte offsets 4/6/8: CF=1 PM1/2.5/10; 10/12/14: atmospheric PM1/2.5/10; µg/m³ |
| Counts / status | Offsets 16..26: counts per 0.1 L above 0.3/0.5/1/2.5/5/10 µm; 28 version, 29 error |
| Commands | `42 4D CMD 00 DATA checksum16`; E1: passive=0/active=1; E2: passive read; E4: sleep=0/wake=1 |

Default active output has variable cadence and repeated frames; passive mode changes reporting, not fan power. Keep inlet/outlet clear and prevent recirculation; enclosure instructions are on p.11.

Bench result, **2026-09-08**: Board 1 received checksum-valid active PMSA003 frames on GPIO18/GPIO17. The initial 24-second capture produced two 10-second application reports with fresh-frame ages below one second and zero parser checksum or length failures across 23 frames. The later automatic 60-row Parquet batch retained all twelve PM/count channels and status fields; stored checksum/length-error, row-drop and missed-deadline counters were zero. Real SD readback matched in PyArrow and DuckDB. This verifies transport, parsing and bounded acquisition/storage on the attached unit, not long-duration reliability, physical warm-up sufficiency or calibration.

### Current logger validity and display lessons

The application continuously drains active UART frames and snapshots the latest accepted frame once per ten-second row. These are snapshots, not ten-second averages. Its status precedence is `0=missing`, `1=warming` (device uptime below 30 seconds), `2=stale` (accepted frame age above 5,000 ms), `3=sensor-error`, `4=valid`. All twelve PM/count values are null unless status is 4; frame age, firmware/error and parser counters preserve diagnostic context when available. The uptime gate is not a tracked sensor wake timestamp; revisit it before introducing sleep/wake or independent sensor resets. [Implementation](../firmware/arduino-m5unified/bringup/telemetry_logger.cpp)

The LCD/`MEAS` report refreshes independently of the Parquet row and can observe a different, newer sensor frame. Do not compare adjacent display lines as if they were the exact stored values. The capture-to-file check matched explicit row sequence/monotonic timestamps; the two host readers compared the same stored values/nulls. A valid UART frame and a software warm-up gate do not validate environmental accuracy.

Parser keywords: bounded streaming, resynchronization, length/checksum/status validation, partial/concatenated-frame tests, stale/error counters, explicit byte decoding. Keep consumption independent of uploads/display. Timeouts mean invalid samples, not zero pollution. Use timestamp-based windows; variable/repeated frames distort frame-count averages. Preserve calibration-field identity; atmospheric fields suit ambient monitoring.

Driver lookup: ESP-IDF `driver/uart.h`, UART event queue/ring buffer; Arduino `HardwareSerial`. [M5 classic PM25 example](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Stack/tree/master/examples/KIT/PM25): protocol cross-check only. A separate PMS library is optional.

## SHT20, only when populated and electrically isolated

The current firmware does **not** acquire SHT20. Electrical isolation/population has not been verified on the attached assembly, so `ambient_temperature_c` and `relative_humidity_percent` remain null. Do not substitute BMI270 die temperature or treat an ACK at the shared `0x40` address as proof that SHT20 is independently readable.

- Address `0x40`; sensor supply 2.1–3.6 V. M134 schematic supplies 3.3 V and adds 4.7 kΩ pull-ups; account for parallel pull-ups when rerouting.
- Current vendor Arduino option: [`Sensirion/arduino-sht` v1.2.6](https://github.com/Sensirion/arduino-sht/releases/tag/v1.2.6), released 2024-11-08; recheck [latest release](https://github.com/Sensirion/arduino-sht/releases/latest) when selecting dependencies. Explicit `SHTSensor::SHT2X` and `init(TwoWire&)` avoid probing unrelated devices. [Tagged source](https://github.com/Sensirion/arduino-sht/blob/v1.2.6/SHTSensor.cpp)
- That driver waits 85 ms for each of T and RH: run acquisition outside latency-sensitive callbacks and compute dew point/VPD from the cached pair. It checks CRC-8 (`0x31`, initial `0`) and status bits before conversion. Keep derived values floating-point. [Tagged implementation](https://github.com/Sensirion/arduino-sht/blob/v1.2.6/SHTSensor.cpp)
- C driver keywords: no-hold `F3/F5`, busy NACK, conversion deadline, CRC before clearing low two status bits; hold mode stretches SCL. **No-hold erratum:** SCL rising edges 15–18.5 µs after command ACK can cause persistent offsets; implement a documented workaround and inspect controller timing. A delay after `endTransmission()` alone does not prove compliant STOP timing. [Datasheet §§5.4–5.8](https://sensirion.com/resource/datasheet/sht20)
- Keep measurement duty below 10%; sample conservatively, e.g. one T/RH pair per 5 s. Thermal separation from the host matters: high T biases RH low; characterize the assembled enclosure before choosing a correction. [Datasheet §2.3](https://sensirion.com/resource/datasheet/sht20)

## Historical repository: narrowly reusable evidence

Explored [`koenvervloesem/M5Stack-Air-Quality-ESPHome` at `6944e355734da4dd42ca969f2c05621a9343eaaa`](https://github.com/koenvervloesem/M5Stack-Air-Quality-ESPHome/tree/6944e355734da4dd42ca969f2c05621a9343eaaa), commit dated 2023-03-16.

- `requirements.txt`: ESPHome **2022.11.0**, Pillow 9.3.0; YAML targets **m5stack-core-esp32**, PMS RX16, I²C21/22 and classic display/button pins. Reuse sensor intent/UI ideas, not dependencies, GPIOs or board initialization.
- `include/sht20.h` polls every **5 s** although the README says one second; additional VPD/dew-point calls remeasure temperature and `int` locals discard fractional humidity/derived values. Cache one pair and calculate locally.
- Its reported hot temperature/low RH is a useful enclosure-test hypothesis, not proof of every revision's behavior. Its disabled BLE provisioning comment records an old firmware memory failure, not a CoreS3 Wi-Fi/BLE limitation.
- If revisiting ESPHome, look up current `pmsx003`, SHT2x support and external-component migration; this file's C/C++ guidance does not depend on ESPHome.
