# Sensor telemetry, Parquet and cloud pipeline

[Router](README.md) · Read for the measurement record, bounded buffer, on-device Parquet, SD durability and later object-storage upload. Hardware-level SD rules remain in [CoreS3 storage](cores3-storage.md). Implementation snapshot **2026-09-08**; measured runs belong in [bench-verified](bench-verified.md), separately from planned validation.

## Current decision

The active Arduino/C++ trial now **generates Parquet on the CoreS3 and stores it on SD**. It acquires one row every **10 seconds**, containing available scalar measurements and explicit validity/status fields. Rotation defaults to **900 seconds** and can be set to **600 seconds** for the running session; reboot restores 900 seconds. The logger buffers up to 90 rows per file:

```text
10-second rows -> bounded PSRAM batch -> Parquet writer -> finalized SD files
                                                               |
                                                               v
                                                later idempotent HTTPS upload
                                                               |
                                                               v
                                                    object storage / queries
```

At this cadence, complete 10- and 15-minute windows contain 60 and 90 rows respectively when no samples are missed. The implementation uses a PSRAM row batch, an eight-row producer queue and a small C++ Parquet writer with no Arrow runtime. Sampling continues into that queue while the storage worker finalizes the batch. Boot, explicit flush, interval changes and clock changes can produce shorter files.

File rotation and reset durability are separate choices. The implemented baseline loses its unfinished RAM batch after reset. It lists and retains `.partial` files on startup without attempting repair. A small SD recovery spool remains a later option if the required loss window is shorter than one rotation. Finalized-file survival still requires power-cut tests before a production durability claim. A real 60-row automatic batch and shorter current-schema Hive files have been read back from SD and opened with both PyArrow and DuckDB. UTC partition agreement, a quarter-hour split and station/file retention across a normal restart were checked separately; a later complete 90-row uncompressed Hive file also passed both readers and UTC-window checks. See [bench-verified](bench-verified.md) for exact firmware, schema and run details.

The motivating [ESP32-S3 Rust trial](https://github.com/walkthru-earth/esp32s3-parquet-test/tree/1f3a6c706f85d54a0abe3105b2eed4c6378d814d) uses the Apache Rust Parquet crate with default features/Arrow disabled and `snap` enabled; its lockfile resolves **56.2.0**. The audited source generates 178 synthetic rows and ten columns, builds a complete in-memory file including its footer, and uploads the bytes. It does not implement SD persistence, continuous real-sensor acquisition or power-loss recovery, and the reviewed checkout contains no independently verifiable device-memory captures or generated-file artifacts. Its documented Zstd comparison is a macOS experiment. This is credible implementation evidence for investigating device-side Parquet, not a CoreS3 benchmark. [Dependencies](https://github.com/walkthru-earth/esp32s3-parquet-test/blob/1f3a6c706f85d54a0abe3105b2eed4c6378d814d/Cargo.toml), [writer](https://github.com/walkthru-earth/esp32s3-parquet-test/blob/1f3a6c706f85d54a0abe3105b2eed4c6378d814d/src/main.rs#L266), [host comparison](https://github.com/walkthru-earth/esp32s3-parquet-test/blob/1f3a6c706f85d54a0abe3105b2eed4c6378d814d/index.md#L591).

Object-storage synchronization follows local file validation. Apache Iceberg is explicitly deferred; plain Parquet files can be uploaded and queried without a table catalog.

The [table and observation model](table-and-observation-model.md) records the static-Iceberg assessment and SensorThings V2 draft findings. Keep table publication on the host/cloud; adopt explicit measurement/provenance semantics in firmware without claiming OGC API compliance. Its first implementation phase is distinct from the 73-column hardware evidence below.

The tested conclusion is now affirmative: this CoreS3 can create interoperable Parquet directly from real ten-second rows on SD, with a full 90-row uncompressed window verified. In three identical-60-row comparisons, LZ4_RAW reduced whole-file bytes by 50.7% and median finalization time by 21.4% versus the same writer uncompressed. That is evidence for this design/workload, not a benchmark against CBOR/JSON, an energy result, a claim about allocated FAT space, or proof of production durability. [Measurements and limits](compression-benchmark.md#hardware-result-lz4-passed)

The active Arduino trial stays active. [ESP-IDF 6.1](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/releases/tag/v6.1) is newer than the ESP-IDF 5.5.5 base inside Arduino-ESP32 3.3.11, but that alone does not justify a second trial. Start an IDF trial only after this implementation produces a measured driver, latency, memory or component limitation and record that finding in the trial README.

## Measurement contract

Every sample has an identity independent of wall-clock quality. Never turn a timeout, bad checksum or stale value into a zero measurement.

| Field | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `schema_version` | Current source: INT32 version 2, file metadata `cores3-telemetry-v2`, 77 columns. Earlier bench images used version 1 with 72/73 columns; check actual schema and image identity. |
| `station_id` | UUID generated once and persisted in NVS (`parquet` namespace, `station` key); carried in file metadata and the Hive directory, not repeated as a numeric row column. Erasing NVS creates a new station identity. |
| `device_id` | INT64 containing the board's 48-bit Wi-Fi station MAC; a hardware identifier, not an anonymized UUID. |
| `boot_id_hi`, `boot_id_lo` | Two INT64 fields carrying a random 128-bit identifier generated once per boot. |
| `sequence` | Monotonic INT64 counter within one boot; device, boot and sequence identify the row. Missed sample deadlines create observable sequence gaps. |
| `monotonic_us` | Acquisition time from the monotonic clock; always present. |
| `event_time_utc_ns` | Nullable INT64 UTC estimate in nanoseconds, with units explicit in the name; no Parquet timestamp logical annotation yet. Absent until the host explicitly supplies UTC. |
| `clock_status`, `clock_epoch` | Status 0 = unsynchronized, 1 = host estimate. Epoch increments at each supplied time anchor; files split when it changes. No measured clock-uncertainty bound or synchronized status is claimed. |
| Measurements | Fixed-width typed fields with units in the schema, not encoded into display strings. |
| Validity | Per-sensor status and validity bits; preserve missing, warming, stale, checksum error and device error distinctly. |
| Provenance | File metadata records firmware, board, station, boot, cadence, status meanings and unavailable measurements. New source adds dictionary version/SHA-256 and acquisition configuration; deployment/calibration are explicitly unknown, with provisioning/history still future work. |
| Additional v2 timing | `collection_completed_mono_us`, `pms_received_mono_us`, `clock_anchor_mono_us`, `clock_anchor_utc_ns`; see [semantics and validity](table-and-observation-model.md#timing-and-validity-dictionary). |

Use `pixi run parquet-device sync-time --port <port>` to explicitly supply this host's current UTC estimate, or `--sync-time` with `parquet-device bench`. The serial `parquet time <epoch-seconds>` command anchors that value to the device monotonic clock and reports the anchor. This is not NTP and does not set or trust the RTC calendar; command/transport latency and host error are not measured. Previously buffered rows retain their original timestamps and epoch. Persisting a separate uncertainty-bearing anchor journal is future work.

The anchor uses the command's monotonic receipt time, not the later time at which the storage worker handles it. This avoids adding worker-queue delay to the clock mapping, but host integer-second truncation and USB latency remain. Station UUID persists across normal resets; the UTC anchor, clock epoch and runtime interval choice do not. A new host time must be supplied after reboot. Source: [current logger](../firmware/arduino-m5unified/bringup/telemetry_logger.cpp).

The current flashed schema has **77 numeric columns**, appending four timing fields to the earlier 73-column codec image and advancing to schema version 2. PMS fields include atmospheric and CF=1 PM1.0/PM2.5/PM10, six cumulative particle-count channels, sensor error and framing/checksum counters. Onboard fields cover IMU readings, raw magnetic counts, raw LTR-553 light/proximity counts, power, RTC calendar, touch and memory/storage health. Unsupported battery current and ambient temperature/humidity remain null; camera frames and microphone audio are outside this scalar schema. Availability and conflicts are documented in [hardware](cores3-hardware.md) and the relevant accessory references. Carry source age/status when a row snapshots a sensor whose acquisition cadence differs from 10 seconds; these snapshots are not interval averages. The new contract passes host tests and short real SD readbacks; see [schema-v2 measured scope](bench-verified.md#board-1-schema-v2-provenance-and-timing).

## Parquet file lifecycle and optional recovery spool

The storage worker creates a uniquely named `.partial` file exclusively, completes column pages and the footer, checks write counts, calls `fflush` and `fsync`, and closes it. It then reads the file back to check length, leading/trailing `PAR1` and footer bounds, and computes a whole-file CRC32 before renaming to `.parquet`. This structural check is not a full Parquet decoder: PyArrow and DuckDB perform host conformance validation. Only finalized files are eligible for later upload; never append rows to one. At boot the current implementation lists both suffixes and retains partial files without repair. FAT rename is not assumed crash-atomic, and automatic formatting is disabled.

The RAM-only baseline makes the unfinished batch expendable and reports that limitation. A recovery spool is an optional subsequent durability feature. If selected, version 1 should use the record and lifecycle below; keep it distinct from the primary Parquet export format.

Serialize the spool manually with explicit byte order. It does not write a native compiler struct or rely on padding.

Each record has:

1. a synchronization marker and format version;
2. header and payload lengths;
3. record type and validity flags;
4. identity, sequence and time fields;
5. fixed-schema payload bytes;
6. standard CRC32 over the versioned header and payload.

Wrap the ESP-IDF CRC API and test it against host-generated known vectors. Its seed, continuation and final inversion rules are easy to apply incorrectly.

The final spool trailer records first and last sequence, record count, byte count and SHA-256 of the committed content. CRC catches a damaged record during streaming recovery; a separate SHA-256 over the finalized Parquet file gives the later uploader a stable content identity.

Use this lifecycle:

1. create a uniquely named `.open` file;
2. append complete records through one storage worker;
3. batch writes in 4–16 KiB, keeping the DMA staging buffer in internal RAM;
4. at a durability boundary, check the write count, call `fflush`, then `fsync`;
5. rotate on the configured Parquet batch boundary or a bounded size;
6. write and sync the trailer, close, validate the file, then rename it `.ready`;
7. build and validate the corresponding immutable Parquet file locally;
8. retire the spool only after that Parquet file is durable under the tested recovery policy.

FAT rename is not assumed to be crash-atomic. At boot, scan both suffixes, validate complete records, recover the longest valid prefix of an `.open` file, and quarantine anything ambiguous. Never autoformat after a mount or recovery failure. Keep upload acknowledgements in a separate small journal so a reset cannot confuse “sent” with “durably accepted.”

An optional spool can remain uncompressed. Measure complete Parquet bytes, CPU time and peak working memory before choosing its page codec; compression is independent of whether a spool is present.

## Memory, tasks and backpressure

- Sensor code parses into typed records and never writes the filesystem directly.
- The 90-row batch and writer workspace reside in the verified 8 MB Quad PSRAM. An eight-row FreeRTOS queue absorbs brief storage stalls; it is allocated by FreeRTOS, not explicitly in PSRAM. Allocation failure disables logging with an error. Queue sizing is still a feasibility choice, not a qualified stall budget.
- One storage task owns FatFS and all SD transactions. It shares the SPI2 bus with the display through one application lock and never waits for network work while holding that lock.
- The writer streams through a 4 KiB stdio buffer on the storage task's internal stack. SD driver staging/DMA remain driver-owned; the application buffer is not advertised as a direct DMA allocation.
- A separate later uploader will read only finalized Parquet files. No retention deletion or object-storage synchronization is implemented yet.
- Queue overflow counts dropped rows. A write failure retains the batch, reports the failure and drops subsequent rows until an explicit flush succeeds; absent storage also counts drops. There is no automatic retry, gap-record journal, hotplug recovery or deletion of older files.

Record sample jitter, queue high-water mark, drops, internal and PSRAM minimum free space, writer time, file bytes/row, SD write p50/p99/max latency, sync latency, incomplete-file count and, once implemented, recovery and upload retry counts. Label measurements by firmware build, configuration, sample count and card model; keep measured results in [bench-verified](bench-verified.md).

## Upload and cloud layout

The SD layout already uses the requested Hive partition directories, ready to preserve as object keys when upload is added. UTC-dated files use:

```text
output/station=<UUID>/year=YYYY/month=MM/day=DD/data_HHMM_<boot>_<first>-<last>-<attempt>.parquet
```

`HHMM` identifies the start of the UTC-aligned 10- or 15-minute window, not the upload time. The boot, sequence-range and attempt suffix prevents distinct files in the same window from overwriting each other after reboot, manual flush or a clock correction. The extension remains `.parquet`; the interval is configuration, not an extension suffix. New windows, midnight and clock-epoch changes split batches. Startup mid-window produces a short first file. Firmware paths include the `/sd` mount prefix; the card/object path starts at `output/`.

The worker detects window/epoch changes on arrival of the next sample; there is no independent wall-clock finalization alarm. A `READY` line proves that one file finalized, not that a full configured window was collected. In particular, `bench --sync-time --until-ready` may retrieve the old unsynced or shortened batch closed by the new anchor. Check row count, sequence range and timestamps before labeling a run a full 10/15-minute test.

Before the host supplies time, rows have null UTC and files go to `output/station=<UUID>/unsynced/boot=<boot>/data_unsynced_<boot>_<first>-<last>-<attempt>.parquet`. They are not assigned a guessed calendar date or retroactively renamed when time becomes available. Date-partition queries must explicitly decide whether and how to include this separate unsynchronized tree.

For the later HTTPS uploader, create-only semantics such as `If-None-Match: *` make retries idempotent. After a timeout, query or retry the same finalized key; never invent a new identity for the same bytes. Stream bounded reads from SD, releasing the shared-bus lock before network waits. The ingestion endpoint should verify length, SHA-256, readable Parquet metadata/pages, sequence range and schema version before acknowledging; delete local files only after a persistent acknowledgement matches size and digest. SHA-256 and acknowledgement persistence are not implemented by the current CRC32 serial-readback helper.

MQTT QoS 1 can carry live gauges, alarms and device health. It is not the durable measurement source because duplicates and reconnect gaps are normal. Deduplicate any live copy by the same row identity.

The ingestion service can accept the device's finalized Parquet directly. Uninterrupted ten-/fifteen-minute rotation produces 144/96 files per station per UTC day; extra splits produce more. Cloud compaction can follow as fleet size and query costs warrant. Apache Iceberg catalog and snapshot management remain later work.

For later deployment, OpenTelemetry belongs at the gateway and ingestion services. The current device emits acquisition/storage counters, heap/queue health and a startup reset report. The new source adds an acquisition configuration identifier and dictionary digest; actual calibration/deployment history, RSSI and upload success remain future work. Translate device health into cloud metrics, logs and traces when networking is added.

## Offline capacity and reconnection

Internet is not required for acquisition or SD finalization. With continuous power and working storage, the current firmware keeps collecting offline; it does not presently connect to a network at all. The host-supplied UTC anchor continues from the monotonic clock during an uninterrupted boot, with unmeasured drift. After reboot, UTC is null and files use the unsynced tree until a new time anchor arrives. The station UUID remains persistent. Power loss can discard the unfinished RAM batch; this is independent of available card space.

**Capacity estimate, not lifetime qualification.** The tested nominal 32 GB card reports a 31,441,764,352-byte filesystem. At one row every ten seconds, there are 8,640 rows/day. Assuming future file sizes resemble the measured files and reserving 20% of the filesystem:

The following file sizes are from the **73-column hardware baseline**. The new 77-column source adds timing data and footer metadata; measure its real compressed files before reusing these rates for deployment planning.

| Measured file basis | Rotation assumed | File bytes/day, excluding FAT allocation overhead | Decimal GB/year | Capacity-only years with 20% reserve |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 60 rows, LZ4_RAW, 14,080 bytes | 10 minutes / 144 files/day | 2,027,520 | 0.74 | ~34 |
| Same 60 rows, uncompressed, 28,537 bytes | 10 minutes / 144 files/day | 4,109,328 | 1.50 | ~17 |
| 90 rows, uncompressed, 39,869 bytes | 15 minutes / 96 files/day | 3,827,424 | 1.40 | ~18 |

These are arithmetic projections, **not claims that the board/card will run for decades**. The current normal interval is 15 minutes; its full 90-row compressed size is not yet measured. Compression varies with values/validity. Directory entries, allocation units, other files, benchmark copies, partial files and short forced batches consume additional space. The actual FAT cluster size is not recorded. For illustration only, if each 10-minute file occupied a 32 KiB cluster, both 14,080 and 28,537-byte files would allocate 32,768 bytes: ~1.72 GB/year and ~15 capacity-years with the same reserve. Thus a 50.7% byte reduction does not automatically halve allocated SD space; it does reduce the bytes a future uploader would send. Measure actual allocated growth before making a retention guarantee.

Card endurance, bit retention, environmental conditions, continuous power, clock accuracy and long-run firmware reliability were not qualified. This is not a battery-runtime estimate. No automatic deletion/retention policy exists: on storage failure the batch is retained in RAM and later drops/errors are counted. A free-space reserve/alarm and tested recovery policy must be implemented before unattended deployment.

**Can it sync afterward? Architecturally yes; currently no uploader exists.** The immutable files and station/date keys can be copied to object storage without re-encoding, but the device has not performed that upload. Remaining work:

1. provision an endpoint, TLS trust and narrowly scoped credentials, without blocking acquisition;
2. enumerate finalized normal files (exclude diagnostic copies/partials), stream bounded SD reads and retry the same object identity after disconnects;
3. verify remote size/content digest and persist acknowledgement locally; never equate a send attempt with durable acceptance;
4. retain local files until that acknowledgement, with an explicit free-space/deletion policy and replay-safe recovery tests;
5. test disconnects, uncertain upload completion, expired credentials, clock changes and power cuts, plus the shared SD/display/radio workload.

Unsynced files must remain explicitly unsynchronized unless a defensible later clock reconstruction exists. Iceberg/catalog management and cloud compaction can follow basic object upload; neither is needed to establish local Parquet feasibility. Network upload, long offline soak and card lifetime therefore remain open validation questions, not completed features.

## C and C++ library assessment

These are dated observations, not floating dependencies.

| Project | Version checked | Fit for CoreS3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Apache Parquet format](https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/releases/tag/apache-parquet-format-2.13.0) | 2.13.0, Apache-2.0 | The wire specification. Metadata and page headers use Thrift Compact Protocol; it is not an embedded writer library. |
| [Apache Arrow C++](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2026/08/10/25.0.1-release/) | 25.0.1, Apache-2.0 | Production Parquet implementation for host/cloud. Its full runtime/dependency graph is not the proposed firmware writer; its footprint does not establish the cost of a bounded Parquet-only implementation. |
| [nanoarrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow-nanoarrow) | 0.9.0, Apache-2.0 | C runtime compiles to a few hundred KiB and writes Arrow IPC through `FILE*`, but it does **not** write Parquet or compressed IPC. |
| [Carquet](https://github.com/Vitruves/carquet) | 0.7.0 in the earlier release snapshot, MIT; re-pin before integration | C11 Parquet reader/writer candidate. Upstream's roughly 200 KB binary claim is not a CoreS3 RAM measurement. Audit its build, codec dependencies and allocator requirements before selecting a firmware subset; no ESP32-S3 qualification is established here. |
| [DuckDB](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/releases/tag/v1.5.5) | 1.5.5, MIT | Excellent host validator, but its database surface and roughly 125 MB per-thread memory guidance are beyond the device budget. |
| [zcbor](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/zcbor/releases/tag/0.9.1) | 0.9.1, Apache-2.0 | Low-footprint C CBOR with CDDL-generated codecs, static-friendly operation and fragmented buffers. |
| [Espressif LZ4](https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/lz4/versions/1.10.0/readme) | 1.10.0, BSD-2-Clause/Apache-2.0 integration | Block state is about 1–16 KiB; Frame defaults need at least 64 KiB and can use PSRAM. Parquet requires raw blocks under `LZ4_RAW`, never LZ4 Frame output. |
| [Zstandard](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/tag/v1.5.7) / [IDF wrapper](https://components.espressif.com/components/rderr/esp-idf-zstd/versions/1.5.7/readme) | 1.5.7, BSD-3-Clause option | The wrapper reports about 65–220 KiB heap plus a dedicated task with roughly 16 KiB stack. Current IDF packaging is lightly used and third-party. |
| [Espressif zlib](https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/zlib/versions/1.3.2~1) | 1.3.2~1, zlib License | Mature official component. Parquet `GZIP` requires a gzip wrapper, not a raw deflate or zlib stream. |
| [Snappy](https://github.com/google/snappy/releases/tag/1.2.2) | 1.2.2, BSD-3-Clause | Fast and widely readable by Parquet tools, but there is no official Espressif component. |

The archived standalone `parquet-cpp` project is not a path forward; its work moved into Apache Arrow. Full Arrow, Velox and DuckDB remain host/cloud tools.

Secondary findings: ESP-IDF's ROM `miniz.h` is a restricted legacy subset and must not be treated as current [miniz 3.1.2](https://github.com/richgel999/miniz/releases). [heatshrink](https://github.com/atomicobject/heatshrink) is small but not a Parquet codec. Current [MessagePack C/C++](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-c/releases) is maintained, while its available ESP registry wrapper is immature and offers no clear advantage over a generated fixed schema. [xxHash 0.8.3](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/releases/tag/v0.8.3) is useful elsewhere but cannot replace the standard CRC32 required by Parquet page checksums.

## Direct Parquet experiment

Parquet allows single-pass creation because column chunks are written before the footer, but readers locate metadata from the final footer. A power cut before that footer leaves an incomplete file, and appending rows to a closed file requires replacing the old footer. Use immutable rotations and an explicit unfinished-batch policy.

The current implementation in the active C/C++ trial uses:

- one immutable file and one row group per rotation;
- flat INT32/INT64/FLOAT columns; the logger provides definition levels for every column, always populating identity/status fields and leaving unavailable measurements/time null;
- PLAIN encoding and Data Page V1;
- UNCOMPRESSED by default after reboot, or session-selectable LZ4_RAW using pinned LZ4 1.10.0;
- bounded page-codec buffers and correct compressed/original byte counts; no Parquet page CRC32 yet, while serial readback has a separate whole-file CRC32;
- a fixed 90-row logger batch and bounded streaming buffers;
- a minimal writer-only Thrift Compact implementation in `parquet_writer.cpp`, without Arrow or Carquet dependencies;
- `.partial` -> sync -> close -> footer validation -> final rename.

Host conformance checks use PyArrow and DuckDB, including nulls and exact integer values. Empty, one-row, boundary-value and wide/maximum-row fixtures pass the host sanitizer test; unsynced and dated files also pass real SD readback. Add multiple-page cases only if that feature is introduced. The automatic 60-row run and current Hive-schema checks are recorded separately in [bench-verified](bench-verified.md); longer runs and failure cases remain open. The [compression experiment](compression-benchmark.md) screens Snappy/LZ4/Zstd on the host and adds an identical-row LZ4_RAW comparison on the board. Measure complete-file bytes, CPU time and memory bounds; on-device Snappy/Zstd and longer codec runs remain open. Separately run repeated power cuts during data, page header, footer, sync and rename before claiming recovery guarantees. The cited Zstd wrapper's memory figures are specific to its dictionary workload, not a CoreS3 budget.

Do not use Parquet's deprecated `LZ4` enum, LZ4 Frame payloads, dictionaries, nested schemas, append-to-finalized files or one file per sample in the first experiment.

## Operational cases to implement

### Lessons established by the feasibility work

- **Format feasibility is narrower than runtime size.** The user's Rust experiment justified revisiting the earlier cloud-only recommendation. The local bounded C++ writer now has real-sensor SD evidence without importing Arrow; that does not make its limited schema support a general-purpose Parquet implementation.
- **Measure complete files.** The first seven-row file had a 5,490-byte footer in 9,494 total bytes; the 60-row file was 28,059 bytes. Metadata overhead matters for small batches. Compare codec candidates on identical full files and distinguish finalization time from encoding-only time.
- **Prove the bytes at each layer.** Writer fixtures, device footer/CRC readback, serial length/offset/CRC checks and independent reader comparison test different failure surfaces. A transfer CRC is neither a Parquet page checksum nor a cryptographic upload identity. Host query partition columns must be checked separately from stored schema columns.
- **Reset, missing data and clock changes need explicit semantics.** Correct serial control-line handling stopped accidental resets; it did not make RAM durable. Null unsupported readings, unsynced paths and immutable clock epochs preserve uncertainty rather than hiding it.
- **More cores do not remove shared-bus ownership.** A separate storage worker absorbed the tested finalization workload, with no measured reason yet to pin cores. Keep DMA completion and the common SPI lock; profile codecs and future radios separately.
- **Keep evidence scoped.** The complete 60-row run used the earlier 72-column image. Current 73-column Hive files, quarter-hour splitting and normal-restart retention have their own short checks. A later full 90-row uncompressed Hive file now has separate readback evidence; compressed endurance, clock-correction stress and power-cut recovery remain open. [Dated artifacts and results](bench-verified.md#board-1-on-device-parquet-and-hive-partitions)

### Remaining operational checklist

[Open Air's firmware](https://github.com/Open-Air-Foundation/firmware-one-openair) was inspected only as a checklist of field cases; no source, schema, protocol or architecture was imported. Our implementation must cover:

- independent sensor schedules and warm-up state;
- checksum resynchronization, invalid and stale measurements;
- bounded queues, explicit drop policy and offline retention;
- watchdog and reset-reason reporting;
- SD removal, full media, short writes and partial-tail recovery;
- Wi-Fi reconnect without blocking acquisition;
- idempotent upload and duplicate handling;
- configuration/calibration versions and safe rollback;
- signed OTA with health confirmation before marking a new image valid;
- visible counters for heap, RSSI, sensor failures, storage failures and upload backlog.

## Implementation order

1. **Implemented:** live 10-second measurement collection, bounded C++ Parquet writer, SD finalization and host conformance/readback tooling in the active Arduino trial.
2. **Hardware readback verified:** automatic 60/90-row uncompressed files, three identical-row LZ4 comparison pairs and a normal compressed Hive smoke file open in both readers; exact scope and measured timings are in [bench-verified](bench-verified.md).
3. **Implemented, partly bench-verified:** persistent station UUID, UTC Hive layout, clock epochs and configurable 600/900-second windows. Station persistence, normal-reset file retention, UTC partition agreement and a quarter-hour boundary split passed. A full 90-row uncompressed window also passed readback; still test midnight and arbitrary clock corrections.
4. Measure actual memory, bytes/row, encoding time, SD latency and sampling jitter across longer runs and failure cases.
5. Compare configured LZ4_RAW and UNCOMPRESSED against identical buffered rows, retaining diagnostic copies outside station trees. Continue with on-device Snappy/Zstd and longer-run memory/latency qualification; see [compression](compression-benchmark.md).
6. Implement the chosen reset-loss policy, adding a recovery spool if needed, and verify controlled reset/power-cut behavior.
7. Add immutable HTTPS upload and acknowledgement retention. Cloud compaction and Apache Iceberg remain later milestones.
